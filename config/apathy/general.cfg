## Optimization ##
##################

# By default, mobs that are currently attacking a player do not check every tick if it's still okay to do so.
# This is how often the mob will check. (Set this to 1 to check every tick.)
# Must be at least 1.
# Default: 20
recheckInterval: 20

# Should Apathy attempt to optimize the rule in the config file, to do less work per tick?
# If your rule is doing something unexpected, or isn't working like it should, try turning this off.
# And report it too, since it's definitely a bug, lol.
# Default: true

## Revenge Spread ##
####################

# Comma-separated list of difficulties.
# If the current world difficulty appears in the set, zombified piglins will alert their friends
# when a player provokes one. This will also spread Apathy's revengeTimer to them.
# Default: easy, normal, hard
angryPiggies: normal, hard

# Let's say this option is set to 10, and you attack a zombie. Other zombies within 10 blocks will have their revengeTimer set, too.
# This option affects mobs of the same type only.
# Please recall that the revengeTimer is an Apathy concept, and Apathy only ever suppresses normal mob AI.
# i.e, this won't cause a mob to attack a player that already wasn't going to.
# Must be at least 0.
# Default: 0
sameTypeRevengeSpread: 0

# When attacking any mob, other mobs within this range will have their revengeTimer set, too.
# This option affects all mobs, whether they have the same type or not.
# Please recall that the revengeTimer is an Apathy concept, and Apathy only ever suppresses normal mob AI.
# i.e, this won't cause a mob to attack a player that already wasn't going to.
# Must be at least 0.
