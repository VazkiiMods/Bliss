# By default, mobs that are currently attacking a player do not check every tick if it's still okay to do so.
# This is how often the mob will check. (Set this to 1 to check every tick.)
# Must be at least 1.
# Default: 20
recheckInterval: 20

# Should Apathy attempt to optimize the rule in the config file, to do less work per tick?
# If your rule is doing something unexpected, or isn't working like it should, try turning this off.
# And report it too, since it's definitely a bug, lol.
