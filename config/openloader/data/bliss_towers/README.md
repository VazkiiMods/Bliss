This pack is based on the popular Forge Mod [Towers of the Wild](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/towers-of-the-wild), 
so all credits go to the original Author [idrae_](https://www.curseforge.com/members/idrae_).

We really wanted to use this mod on 1.17+ so we decided to port it.

First, it started as as a Fabric Mod. **Starting with version v3.0.0, it's available as a Vanilla Datapack**, which means you don't even need any modloader!

### !!! Important !!!<!-- omit in toc -->
If you are running 1.18.1 or lower please refer to the branch for [1.17.x](https://github.com/WaldiNet/Towers_Of_The_Wild_Reworked/tree/1.17.x) or [1.18.1](https://github.com/WaldiNet/Towers_Of_The_Wild_Reworked/tree/fabric-1.18.1)

This datapack adds tall towers in your world, inspired by **The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild**.

This will make your explorations a bit more exciting !

At the top of the tower *(which is purposely not so easy to climb)*, you will find a chest with some loot, as well as a nice view :)

Plus, it is also compatible with the [Waystones (Fabric Edition)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones-fabric) and [Fabric Waystones](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-waystones) mod. If you have one of these mods installed a waystone will spawn on top of each tower.

This pack does not add any blocks or items to the game *(if that matters to you)*.
